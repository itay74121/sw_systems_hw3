## This project is constructed with two parts
### The first part: Sorting arrays using insertion sort without using the [] notation
To bypass this obsctacle of not using the [] notation, we wrote a functions that would do this for us.
We constructed one get function and one set function (named them setinarr and getinarr) and then implemented the rest acordingly.
### The second part: Searching in strings
Given a word and mode a or b do the following.
Option a: You must print all the lines that have this particular string in them.
Option b: You must print all the words that are so simmilar to the given word just by removing one letter.
